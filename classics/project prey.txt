this is a project to simulate a basic ecosystem using oop and symple list iteration

it will only compute predator and prey behaviour using simlple variables and object atributes

if a prey survive an x amout of iteratios, it can assexually reproduce (clone itself) wtih some moditfications in its aributess
the same occurs to a predator if it succesfully cath it's prey

if the predator cathces a prey, the prey ceases to exist (get's removed from the list of objects)
